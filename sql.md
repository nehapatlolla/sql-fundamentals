Database software is software that is designed to create databases and to store, manage, search, and extract the information contained within them.

The software also handles data storage, backup and reporting, multi-access control, and security.

# What is database?

- Database is a software which is used to store the data
- Cloud is preesnt in the data
- Cloud is renting pc
- Amazon leads $100 billion cloud market
- Netflix is using AWS

## Why we should not buy?

1. high initial cost
2. storage space
3. Ac
4. Power bill
5. maintenance
6. spare parts
7. generator
8.

## Disaster management

1. We wont keep our servers where disasters occur

2. Some disasters we cant avoid so we keep the back up.

3. keep the back up data where it is safe it might be the other country also

4. We cannot go and ask for backup in the other countries , so we use MNC's, Mncs can ask for backup or rent.

Windows and Mac!!! has the problem i.e we are paying the licensce fee, sql cannot be runned on linux

> Most used Os is Linux

- free
- open source - boat sink example, if boat has the hole , everyone die so it is their responsibility for all to solve the problem
- secure- fixes the bug
- smaller footprint - lesser ram you use, lesser money

distrose

## Scaling

- Scaling, in simple terms, refers to the ability of a system, service, or application to handle an increasing amount of work or traffic as demand grows, without breaking or becoming slow or unstable.

- vertical scaling: More ram, CPU power,storage space, network bandwidth

- Vertical scaling involves adding more resources (such as upgrading hardware components) to an existing system to increase its capacity

- Horizontal: Adding more computers

- Horizontal scaling involves adding more instances or copies of a system to distribute the workload across multiple machines.

- Offices uses which ever is cheaper.

- The choice in the office between vertical and horizontal scaling depends on factors such as the nature of the workload, budget constraints, existing infrastructure, and scalability requirements.

### Autoscaling

Autoscaling solves this problem by `automatically adjusting the number of servers  or resources` allocated to your website based on real-time demand. When traffic increases, autoscaling automatically adds more servers or resources to handle the load. And when traffic decreases, it removes unnecessary servers or resources to save costs.

### how will you go bankrupt, if autoscaling is on?

DDoS Attack:

Identify ddos:

1. filtering
2. captcha
3. ip address filtering

Divert the flow

## Database why?

Ram is temporary , volatile

Hard disk is permanent , slow

If people are demanding the data more keep the copy in the ram.

In that case reading speed increases.

If we open the game, it loads because, it copies the data from the hard disk to ram.

Bottleneck is HDD (Hard disk)

Instead of the HDD people are using the SSD because hdd is slow.

1. frequently asked it will have it in the ram
2. Querying becomes easier
3. CRUD : easy
4. Backups are inbuilt
5. Undo- easily(time limit)
6. performance

## SQL vs NO SQL

| Relational (Tables with Rows and Columns)            | Columns) Various (Document, Key-Value, Columnar, Graph, etc.)                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complex Queries, Transactions, Structured Data       | High Volume, High Velocity, Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data                 |
| MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server                        | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase                                             |
| ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Eventual Consistency (May sacrifice consistency for performance and scalability) |
